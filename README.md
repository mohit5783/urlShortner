## Features âœ¨
* REST API Developed in Node.js using Express.
* Frontend Developed using React.js.
* MongoDB Cloud is used as database.


## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
You will need to have [[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)] or [[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)] installed in your machine. I'll prefer Node (NPM)

### Database
No need to worry, Developer already taken care of that. The Database is in cloud and is accessible from anywhere. 

### API
Open the command prompt
Letz first reach to the "API" folder using CD
```
> $ cd URLShortner\API
> $ npm install
```
Compiles and hot-reloads for development:
```
> $ npm start
```
This will start the backend server
```
> url-shortner-api@1.0.0 start YourPath\Nintex\URLShortner\API
> nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.6
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Listening to port 5000

```
This means our server is live on port 5000

### Frontend
Open another command prompt
now reach to the directory named "aa-react-app" 
```
> $ cd cd URLShortner\App 
> $ npm install
```
Compiles and hot-reloads for development:
```
> $ npm start
```
After running this command it will automatically pop out the running application in your favorite browser. If everything goes well, you would see the screen where you have a textbox to enter a Long URL to convert it into Smaller or Short URL.

## Usage ðŸ’¡
After successful URL Conversion you would be able to see the Short URL below the textbox.
